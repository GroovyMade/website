**The back office for smart founders.**

Groovy Made helps founders turn good ideas into real revenue. We take care of contracts, payments, admin, and taxes â€“ so you can stay focused on building and getting paid, instead of on corporate drama.

ðŸ‘‹ Hey â€“ thanks for dropping by.

If youâ€™ve ever built a product, you know the feeling:

Youâ€™ve got the idea, the code, the IP â€“ but then come the contracts, taxes, payments, refunds, and admin spread across three countries. The stuff nobody talks about when youâ€™re dreaming up your next big thing.

Weâ€™ve lived that too.

So we built Groovy Made â€“ **the back office for smart founders.**

We handle everything behind the scenes so you can focus on building and launching.

No equity drama.  
No corporate clutter.  
No messy spreadsheets.  

Just clean, fair royalty payouts â€“ and optional help with the extra stuff you need to grow.

## What we do

* Draft simple royalty partnership agreements.
* Register your project under our umbrella.
* Run payments, handle refunds, manage taxes.
* Keep every project tracked with its own profit and loss.
* Pay you up to **80% of net receipts**, quarterly.
* Offer **optional services** â€“ launch help, marketing, light branding or advisory â€“ if and when you want it.

## Who itâ€™s for

* Indie founders, solo builders, tiny teams.  
* One-person plugins. AI experiments. Small SaaS.  
* Anyone who wants to launch and get paid, without the overhead.

## How it works

1. **Bring your idea.** If itâ€™s real IP, weâ€™ll help you wrap it properly.
2. **We run the back office.** Contracts, admin, billing, taxes â€“ all handled. You stay focused on the product.
3. **You get paid.** Quarterly royalties. Each project stays clean and separate. No hidden mingling. Just clear statements and fair splits.

##  Built-in benefits

* Merchant of Record for your sales
* Customer payments, refunds, and VAT sorted
* Hiring, contracting, accounting
* Quarterly royalty statements you can trust
* Optional marketing, launch help, or branding support.
* No share dilution â€“ you keep the upside.

## Whoâ€™s behind it

Weâ€™re a small group of builders, operators, and legal minds who know how to keep good ideas simple â€“ and keep founders out of admin hell.

No corporate fluff. No endless calls. Just the back office you wish you didnâ€™t have to think about.

# Why royalties?

Sometimes you donâ€™t need new cofounders.

Sometimes you donâ€™t want to split up your equity pie.  

Sometimes you just want a clean way to launch, share revenue, and keep control.

Groovy Made makes that simple.

## Letâ€™s build something groovy

If youâ€™ve got something worth shipping â€“ and youâ€™d rather spend your days building while we handle the back end â€“ letâ€™s talk.
